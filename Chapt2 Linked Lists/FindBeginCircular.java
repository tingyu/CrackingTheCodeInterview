/*
Part 1: Detect If Linked List Has A Loop
An easy way to detect if a linked list has a loop is through the FastRunner / Slow-
Runner approach. FastRunner moves two steps at a time, while SlowRunner moves
one step. Much like two cars racing around a track at different steps, they must eventu-
ally meet.

An astute reader may wonder if FastRunner might"hopover"SlowRunner completely,
without ever colliding. That's not possible. Suppose that FastRunner did hop over
SlowRunner, such that SlowRunner is at spot i and FastRunner is at spot i + 1. In
the previous step, SlowRunner would be at spot i - 1 and FastRunner would at spot
((i + 1) - 2),orspoti - 1. That is, they would have collided


Part 2: When Do They Collide?
Let's assume that the linked list has a "non-looped" part of size k.

If we apply our algorithm from part 1, when will FastRunner and SlowRunner collide?
We know that for every p steps that SlowRunner takes, FastRunner has taken 2p
steps. Therefore, when SlowRunner enters the looped portion after k steps, Fast-
Runner has taken 2k steps total and must be 2k - k steps, or k steps, into the looped
portion. Since k might be much larger than the loop length, we should actually write
this as mod ( k , LOOP_SIZE) steps, which we will denote as K.

At each subsequent step, FastRunner and SlowRunner get either one step farther
away or one step closer, depending on your perspective. That is, because we are in a
circle, when A moves q steps away from B, it is also moving q steps closer to B.
So now we know the following facts:
1. SlowRunner is 0 steps into the loop.
2. FastRunner is K steps into the loop.
3. SlowRunner is K steps behind FastRunner.
4. FastRunner is LOOP_SIZE - K steps behind SlowRunner.
5. FastRunner catches up to SlowRunner at a rate of 1 step per unit of time.
So, when do they meet? Well, if FastRunner is LOOP_SIZE - K steps behind Slow-
Runner, and FastRunner catches up at a rate of 1 step per unit of time, then they meet
after LOOP_SIZE - K steps. At this point, they will be K steps before the head of the
loop. Let's call this point CollisionSpot.



Part 3: How Do You Find The Start of the Loop?
We now know that CollisionSpot is K nodes before the start of the loop. Because K
= mod(k, LOOP_SIZE) (or, in other words, k = K + M * LOOP_SIZE, for any integer
M), it is also correct to say that it is k nodes from the loop start. For example, if node N
is 2 nodes into a 5 node loop, it is also correct to say that it is 7,12, or even 397 nodes
into the loop.
Therefore, both CollisionSpot and LinkedListHead are k nodes from the start of
the loop.
Now, if we keepone pointer at CollisionSpot and move the other one to LinkedLis-
tHead, they will each be k nodes from LoopStart. Moving the two pointers at the
same speed will cause them to collide againâ€”this time after k steps, at which point they
will both be at LoopStart. All we have to do is return this node.


Part 4: Putting It All Together
To summarize, we move FastPointer twice as fast as SlowPointer. When Slow-
Pointer enters the loop, after k nodes, FastPointer is k nodes into the linked list.
This means that FastPointer and SlowPointer are LOOP_SIZE - k nodes away
from each other.
Next, if FastPointer moves two nodes for each node that SlowPointer moves, they
move one node closer to each other on each turn. Therefore, they will meet after LOOP_
SIZE - k turns. Both will be k nodes from the front of the loop.
The head of the linked list is also k nodes from the front of the loop. So, if we keepone
pointer where it is, and move the other pointer to the head of the linked list, then they
will meet at the front of the loop.
Our algorithm is derived directly from parts 1,2 and 3.
1. Create two pointers, FastPointer and SlowPointer.
2. Move FastPointer at a rate of 2 steps and SlowPointer at a rate of 1 step.
3. When they collide, move SlowPointer to LinkedListHead. Keep FastPointer where it is.
4. Move SlowPointer and FastPointer at a rate of one step. Return the new colli-
sion point
